Project: Ritter Sport – Production Load Balancing Decision Support Tool (PoC)

Primary goal
- Build a 2-week Proof of Concept for a decision support tool that helps production planners optimize weekly load distribution across Mon–Fri and 5 production lines, replacing manual educated guesses with data-driven forecasting and optimization.

Use case
- Managers meet to define production requirements/demands for upcoming 1-2 weeks
- Planner inputs: A) Requirements (manager-defined demands), B) Constraints (or modify defaults), C) Other factors
- System outputs: A) Load forecast based on historical data + Ritter Sport insights, B) Optimized load distribution across weekdays and machines
- Result: Better load balancing → cost efficiency, manageable work hours, satisfied employees

Directory map (working areas)
- 2024/, 2025/ → Raw weekly Excel files by area (H2_H3, H4, M2_M3)
- planning/ → Plans and breakdowns (do not code here)
- tasks/ → Checklists, timeline, backlog (keep current)
- docs/ → Data dictionary and sample list (must reflect reality)
- config/ → Project configs (personnel‑intensive taxonomy)
- src/etl/ → ETL code (ingest.py, utils.py)
- data/processed/ → Normalized outputs written by ETL
- data/reports/ → JSON/HTML ingest reports written by ETL
- logs/ → Human‑friendly logs from ETL and later steps

Constraints snapshot (implement minimally in PoC)
- 3 shifts/day; 5 lines overall; at least one line idle per day
- No simultaneous personnel‑intensive sorts (config/personnel_intensive.yml)
- Prefer not to split sort blocks on Hohl; interruptions on Massiv acceptable (soft in PoC)
- Avoid same sort on consecutive days (soft for PoC unless trivial)

Data ingestion (Section 1) outputs
- data/processed/normalized_daily.csv (required)
- data/reports/ingest_summary_<timestamp>.json
- logs/ingest_<timestamp>.log
- docs/data_dictionary.md kept in sync; docs/data_sample_list.md lists the sampled files

Planner interface requirements
- Input forms: A) Production requirements/demands (quantities, products, deadlines), B) Constraints (override defaults), C) Additional factors
- Forecasting engine: Historical data analysis + Ritter Sport domain insights → predicted load distribution
- Optimization engine: Balance load across Mon-Fri and 5 lines while respecting all constraints
- Output: Clear weekly schedule with rationale, constraint compliance indicators, load distribution metrics

Development workflow (always follow)
1) Before coding: consult readme.md and planning/* to confirm intent and scope.
2) Focus on planner user experience: clear inputs, transparent forecasting, actionable optimization outputs.
3) For ETL, create/modify only under src/etl/, config/, data/, docs/, logs/.
4) After edits: ensure no lints; keep logs clear and helpful; update tasks and docs.
5) Produce demo‑ready artifacts early and iterate (working planner interface + optimization results).

Tasks hygiene
- Keep tasks/section1_checklist.md updated as steps complete.
- Log any deviations or discoveries in the checklist or docs/data_dictionary.md.
- Add new work beyond PoC scope to tasks/backlog.md, not to the active checklist.

Logging & reporting
- Logs must be clear, user‑friendly, and actionable (counts, what was assumed, warnings, decisions).
- Summarize each run: files processed, rows used, anomalies, unknown line %, caps applied.
- Prefer JSON report for machine-readability and reproducibility.

Naming & normalization
- Lines: hohl2, hohl3, hohl4, massiv2, massiv3 (lowercase, no spaces)
- Normalized columns (minimum): date, weekday, kw, line, total_hours
- Provenance: include source_file, source_type (Konzept|Version1|unknown)
- Personnel‑intensive tagging via config/personnel_intensive.yml terms/aliases

Quality gates (PoC level)
- No NaNs in required normalized columns
- Cap day×line totals at 24 hours (with warnings)
- ≥90% of usable rows yield valid date+line (H4 fully known; ≤20% unknown in multi‑line areas)
- Personnel‑intensive tagging verified on exemplars

Visualization & demo
- Reuse production-analysis.html style for clarity
- Show before/after: daily stacked bars, avg active lines, constraint badges, and a KPI row

Frontend UI/style (soft rule)
- Keep the planner UI professional and minimal; avoid excessive emojis or playful decorations
- Use neutral titles/headings and concise copy; rely on color/typography/layout for emphasis
- Use icons sparingly to improve clarity (status/progress), not for decoration
- Prefer consistent spacing, alignment, and readable charts over visual gimmicks

If uncertain
- Prefer minimal, explainable choices; log assumptions and add an item to tasks/backlog.md
- Do not expand scope beyond the PoC plan without recording it in planning/ or tasks/
